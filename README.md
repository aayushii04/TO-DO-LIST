PROJECT NAME - TO-DO LIST APPLICATION
DESCRIPTION:# ‚úÖ Simple To-Do List Application

## üìù Project Description

This project is a straightforward, functional **To-Do List web application**. It allows users to effectively manage their daily tasks by providing the essential tools to add, organize, and remove items from their list.

The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience and a practical understanding of core front-end technologies:

* **HTML:** Used to structure the application's interface (input field, list container, buttons).
* **CSS:** Used for styling, ensuring the application is visually clean and user-friendly.
* **JavaScript:** The core functionality for handling user input, performing **DOM manipulation** (dynamically adding and removing list items), and managing the task data.

This application is an excellent foundation for understanding how to create a dynamic interface that updates instantly based on user interactions.

## üöÄ Key Functionality

The application includes the following features to manage tasks:

1.  **Adding Tasks:** Users can type a task into the input field and press a button (or the Enter key) to instantly add the new item to the list.
2.  **Displaying Tasks:** Each task is displayed as a list item in the main container.
3.  **Removing Tasks:** Each task has a designated way (e.g., a "Delete" button or an "X" icon) that allows the user to permanently remove the item from the list.
4.  **Marking as Complete (Optional):** *(Include this if your version allows users to click or check an item to cross it off or change its color.)* Users can click on a task to toggle its completion status, visually indicating which items are done.

## üíª How to Use and Run the Project

Since the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic are contained within a single file, running the application is very easy.

1.  **Save the File:** Ensure all your code is saved in a single file (e.g., `index.html` or `todo.html`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** Locate the saved HTML file on your computer.
3.  **Double-Click:** Double-click the file to open it in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

The To-Do List interface will load immediately.

### User Instructions:

1.  **To Add a Task:** Type your task into the input box and click the **Add** button (or press **Enter**).
2.  **To Remove a Task:** Click the **\[X / Delete]** button next to the task you wish to delete.
3.  **To Mark as Complete:** *(If implemented)* Click directly on the text of the task item to toggle its "completed" style.
